Resolution of problems that were given by the Teacher

#This repository can be used to post the problems that we will solve in class.
#We should use comments and variables that makes sense, i.e = triangleArea, instead of ta, b, c or something like this.
#It is a good practice for we to comment each line in order to explain what the piece of code does.
#Using global variables is bad, using goto is very bad and not encouraged.
#Divide and conquer your code, it is a good practice in order to achiev success, divide it in small parts and everything should be ok.
#Never copy other person work(re-use if it is a open-source software), think always even if it is very hard. #www.stackoverflow is a good place for we to compare or check what a piece of code or a function does.
